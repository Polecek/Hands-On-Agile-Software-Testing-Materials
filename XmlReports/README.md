# Exercise 2: Xml Reports

## Instructions

1) The class you want to test is XMLExporter - you should aim for 100% code coverage
2) There is an empty test: XMLExporterTest. 
    - Add test cases for all four of the methods in XMLExporter
    - Note: There is useful test data in SampleModelObjects
3) Feel free to add more data in SampleModelObjects or modify what's there, so you can get 100% coverage
